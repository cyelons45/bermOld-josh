	<h4>Welcome to the B.E.R.M Explorer!<p style="font-size:14px">A product of the <a href="https://www.scdhec.gov"> South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control</a></p></h4>
	<p>This application is designed to provide South Carolina beachfront communities, researchers and the general public access to topographic and bathymetric data for various beach areas in South Carolina.</p>	
	<h4><u>Symbology</u></h4>
<table style="width:90%; border:1px solid white; border-collapse: collapse;">
<tr><td style="width:5%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;"><img src=images/overlap.png width="30"/></td><td style="width:20%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Corrected Overlaps</td><td style="border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Occasionally, overlaps of collection points occur. Overlaps are areas along the collection path where the seaward order of collection is interrupted and for a short period collection points move back toward the shore before again moving seaward. The overlapping points are removed to create a generally seaward moving transect. </td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td style="width:5%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;"><img src=images/gap.png width="30"/></td><td style="width:20%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Collection Gaps</td><td style="border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Often during the collection process, impediments or obstructions appear. These are typically buildings, thick scrub or marsh areas. Because the transects are created from the collection points, collection gaps are not readily apparent.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td style="width:5%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;"><img src=images/transect.png width="30"/></td><td style="width:20%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Transects</td><td style="border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Transects are simply the "lines" created from collections points.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td style="width:5%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;"><img src=images/compare.png width="30"/></td><td style="width:20%; border-bottom:1pt solid white;">Comparison Transects</td><td style="border-bottom:1pt solid white;">There is variation in the "path" of yearly transects. Comparison transects are simplified representations of the all the yearly transects for a given monument and are used only as a means of selecting transects for comparison over various years.</td></tr>

	<h4><u>Map Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to navigate:<br/><br/>1. Use the Beach Area dropdown <img src=images/qnav.png width="150"/> to quickly navigate to a specific beach area <br/>2. Click a beach location symbol on the map interface <img src=images/bullseye.png /> to quickly navigate to a specific beach area <br/>3. Use the basemap toggle <img src=images/streets.jpg width="20"/> to toggle between street and imagery basemaps<br/>4. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br/>5. Hold Down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br/>6. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br/>7. Click the + or -  to zoom in/out<br/>8. Click the Home button <img src=images/home.png width="20"/> to zoom to the initial extent</p>
	<h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
        <p>Map data is not displayed at all scales. Use the map navigation components to find the beach area you're interested in analyzing. Once zoomed into the desired location, use the Berm Data Sets selection box <img src=images/dataselect.png width="80"/> to choose the data set you would like to examine, or choose the "All" option to compare data sets over multiple years.<br><br>For individual years, select ("Click") a transect. Data collection points for that transect will be displayed in beach profile chart/graph. The profile is a side-view or "slice" of beach topographic and nearshore bathymetry along the transect. Transect (beach monument) number and collection date is displayed on the top of the chart.<br><br><img src=images/chart.png width="900" /><br><br>
After the profile is displayed in the chart, moving your mouse (cursor) over the chart will reveal the topographic/bathymetric value and corresponding location of that point on the map. As you move over the chart, location symbol moves along the transect.<br><br><img src=images/graphlocation.png width="500"/><br><br>
On the upper right corner of the profile chart, you'll see a small button. <img src=images/downloadbutton.png width="30"/> Selecting this button allows the user to download the profile chart as a .PNG. <br><br>
In addition to the chart download, a preformatted page designed for printing is also available. It features a map showing the selected transect and its corresponding beach profile chart. It can be launched using the "Print" button <img src=images/print.png width="40"/>. The print template is only available when a transect is selected.<br><br>
If you choose the "All" option, the selection operations are the same, but the chart will feature all available data years for that transect. The profile chart contains profiles for each year, which can be turned on/off using the chart legend.<br><br><img src=images/chartcompare.png width="900"/><br>The mouseover location function and print template are disable in "All" mode.<br><br>
<u>IMPORTANT NOTE</u>: Data collection typically starts at or very near the beachfront geodetic monuments. However, monuments are periodically replaced which can mean being relocated several feet or yards from the previous location. Due to monument replacement, as well as other factors, collection does not begin at the exact same location each year, there is sometimes
a substantial landward or seaward difference in collection sets. Like most charts, the charting library
used in BERM Explorer assumes that the first point in the collection should be plotted from the "zero"
position on the chart. Because of differing starting position over the various collection years for each
transect, this can cause an offset when multiple years are plotted (compared) on the chart in BERM
Explorer. To account for differing starting points, OCRM determined the most landward point for each
transect from the 2014-2016 data sets, used those selected points to generate a line. The line was
buffered 100 feet. Then, the selected starting points were compared with the resulting 100-foot buffered
line to determine the closest point on the line for each. Those resulting points were used to
re-calculate the distance value.This value is used in BERM Explorer to insure that differing starting
points are reflected accurately in the BERM Explorer profile chart. OCRM chose to use the 100-foot offset because it allows for flexibility in the event beachfront geodetic monuments are relocated substantially landward in the future. This does not substantially alter the profile. It simply ensures that the profiles plot correctly in relation to profiles from other years. This is only used for comparison of multiple years. Individual profiles are plotted using the distance values collected in the field.<br><br>
Topographic/bathymetry datasets, divided by beach area, are available for download as zip files. Click the "Download" button.<img src=images/download.png width="40"/> Each zip file contains and ESRI shapefile and a comma-delimited .CSV file.
